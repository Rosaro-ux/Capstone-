                <h2>Method</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Score the duck skin, rub all over with sea salt and black pepper,
                     then place the fillets skin side down in a cold non-stick frying pan and turn the heat on to medium. Cook for 8 minutes without moving the duck, until the fat is well rendered and the skin is golden and crisp. Turn the duck over and cook for a further 4 minutes, basting with the fat.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, pick the sage leaves. Trim the broccoli stalks, halving the stems lengthways. Top and tail the orange, trim off the skin and either slice into rounds or segments, and toss with 1 teaspoon of red wine vinegar and a small pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
                    <li>When the timeâ€™s up, remove the duck to a plate to rest, leaving the pan on the heat. Add the sage leaves for 1 minute, or until crispy, jiggling the pan occasionally and transferring them to the duck plate as you go.</li>
                    <li>Cook the broccoli in the pan for 4 minutes, or until lightly charred. Pour in the beans (juices and all), then cover and cook for 3 minutes. Season to perfection, divide between plates and drizzle over any resting juices.</li>
                    <li>Slice the duck and arrange on top, and scatter over the crispy sage and orange.</li>
                </ol>
